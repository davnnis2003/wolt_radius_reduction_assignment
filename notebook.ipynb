    "# Overview of this Notebook and the approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Toolings used\n",
    "* Python v3.11\n",
    "  * Pandas\n",
    "  * psycopg2\n",
    "  * sqlalchemy\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "* PostgreSQL v16\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The schema of the simple DWH (Data Warehouse) in PostgreSQL\n",
    "* `ods`: It stands for Operational Data Store, the very first landing area of the flat CSV files in the DWH\n",
    "* `int`: An intermediate layer for storing tables during the transformation process\n",
    "* `dim`: A delicate schema for Dimension tables. See [Dimensional modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_modeling)\n",
    "* `fct`: A delicate schema for Fact tables.\n",
    "* `sum`: A delicate schema for Summary tables which contain pre-computed & pre-aggregated business metrics, consuming from tables in the `dim` & `fct` schemas only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Ingestion\n",
    "It was done with Python ( Pandas, psycopg2, and sqlalchemy) and ingesting the 2 given CSV files (i.e. `purchases` & `delivery_radius_log`) into the `ods` schema in the PostgreSQL DWH.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transformation\n",
    "The goal of the Data Transformation is usually creating tables (Data Marts) in the `dim`, `fct`, and `sum` schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple Data Marts (e.g. the Dimension Table of `delivery_areas`), it would directly consume from `ods`. If the transformation is complex, `int` is used to store the intermediate transformed tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if there is a lot more data than the given task here, potentially an extra layer between the `ods`  and the `int` schema can be added to centralize all the cleaning logic. It can be named as [the \"Staging layer\"](https://medium.com/data-panda/dbt-models-staging-layer-55f0f2ddc5e4) like dbt Labs, or just the \"Data Layer\"/\"Merge Layer\" from a more old school practice.\n"

    "* How many purchases and how much revenue (End Amount With VAT Eur) do we produce during the hour?\n",
    "* How long do the deviations (reductions) from default radius last during the hour? How many times have we modified the radius during the hour?\n",

    "\n",
    "From the requirement of Task 2, it is obvious that a Summary table needs to be built. The spec of this Summary table would be:\n",
    "1. Aggregated to the **hourly level**. Along with the Delivery Area information, it means the combined key of the `base_hour` + `delivery_area_id` columns should be there as the basic dimensions.\n",
    "2. As for Metrics, these columns would have to be there as well:\n",
    "    * Sales related: Purchases & Revenue (End Amount with Vat Eur). They\n",
    "    * Delivery Radius related: Reduction duration & the frequency of delivery radius changing events (both expansion & reduction)\n",
    "      * Also, it is assumed that all changes in the Delivery Radius are to be included (regardless if they are manually modifying events or automatically triggered)\n",
    "3. On top of all 4 Metrics mentioned in point 2, WoW (Week-over-week) difference in percentage (%) would also need to be derived from them\n",
    "    * It is also assumed that the WoW comparison window would be the same Day of the Week **and** same Hour of the Day, e.g. the number of Purchases from this Monday 1800 - 1900 would only be compared to the number of Purchases from last Monday 1800 - 1900.\n",

    "From the technical perspective, here is the outline of the steps to take to build the Summary table\n",
    "1. Preparation steps\n",
    "    1. Generate a Fact table of Purchases\n",
    "    2. Generate a Dimension table of all Delivery Areas\n",
    "2. Development of intermediate tables\n",
    "    1. Build the bases:\n",
    "        1. Base Hours: Build an intermediate table containing all hours from 1 Jan 2022 till 31 Dec 2022\n",
    "        2. Base Hours with all Delivery Areas: Get all possible combinations of Base Hours & Delivery Areas with a CROSS JOIN\n",
    "    2. Calculate the aggregated Sales Metrics (i.e. purchases and revenue) per hour per Delivery Area\n",
    "    3. Calculate the aggregated Delivery Radius Metrics\n",
    "        1. Calculate the aggregated Reduction duration per hour per Delivery Area\n",
    "        2. Calculate the number of delivery radius changing events per hour per Delivery Area\n",
    "3. Putting everything from step 2 together, by:\n",
    "    * Using the base table from 2A as the base, then\n",
    "    * LEFT JOIN the aggregated table from 2B to fetch purchases & revenue\n",
    "    * LEFT JOIN the aggregated table from 2C to fetch reduction duration & revenue number of delivery radius changing events\n",
    "4. Based on the table from step 3, calculate the WoW percentage difference\n",
    "    * COALESCE function would need to be used to replace NULLs with 0 if no metrics are found for that particular window\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the very beginning of this notebook, different layers of data are being introduced as a simple Data Warehouse architecture:\n",
    "1. `ods` schema as the Operational Data Store, the very first landing area of the ingested data (e.g. flat CSV files)\n",
    "2. `int` schema as the temp storage of the intermediate transformed data\n",
    "3. `dim`, `fct`, and `sum` schemas for different types of Data Marts (i.e. Dimension, Fact, and Summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of rationale of this architecture:\n",
    "* The data from the 2 flat files needs to be cleaned at the 1st step of entering the Data Warehouse; AND,\n",
    "* The cleaned data needs to be transformed and the same transformation should only happen once (i.e. NO duplicated code or data)\n",
    "* Having a Data Mart type-specific schema so enforce the modeling thinking while designing & consuming from the tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "The pros of doing so mostly reaping the benefits of Dimensional Modelling as the most popular data modeling practice in the market:\n",
    "1. The easiest to understand (by business stakeholders); AND,\n",
    "2. Rather flexible to adapt to unexpected business development (e.g. introduction of new Entities, new business models, etc.);\n",
    "    * For comparison, the Inmon model for example would take a lot more planning ahead of implementation and may become a luxury for many companies with the given business dynamic in the modern days.\n",
    "3. Also, having different layers of data is essential to avoid spaghetti code - which is vital for long-term maintenance of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, when the organization scales up, solely by Dimension modeling itself won't be enough to get the job done properly - it may need additional enhancement from Data Mesh (and, depending on the industry & business needs, certain elements from Data Vault should be borrowed as well). And to further enhance the implementation of Data Mesh, Data Contracts could also be considered as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "* Building the Data Warehouse structure requires extra investment of time & effort in short term\n",
    "* The Dimensional Modelling requires both the data team and stakeholders to have a good understanding of the Primary Key. Or else, it may lead to query performance issues or inaccurately calculated KPIs\n",
    "* Stakeholders may need further education & promotion to know how to properly use tables in `sum` schema, e.g. provided example queries\n",
    "* Changes in source data themselves are not tracked by default (only the latest state of the data will be kept). That is rather the strong suit of Data Vault, not the Kimball model's\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the Tech Debt part (especially the query performance-related engineering decisions), it is a calculated risk to take. When it comes to analytics, the speed of delivery is also vital - especially for time-sensitive requests. Once it is delivered, a disciplined BI/data team should always spare a certain portion of capacity (e.g. 5%) for incremental refactoring to ensure the quality of code in the long run.\n",

    "## How could the solution be improved if given more time and data?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest constraints of the current solution is the database (the SQL dialect - to be very specific). The currently selected solution of the database is PostgreSQL v16, and the only reason for selecting it is the nature of open-source and free. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the current size of the data (i.e. the 2 CSV  files), it is okay-ish to handle the data transformation with the above approach (e.g. using JOINs instead of Windows Function, processing the data without the required Primary Key and the `updated_at` timestamp, etc.). When the volume of the data increases as the business grows, the performance of the above queries in PostgreSQL is likely to degrade, and cost could also increase faster than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the usability of the produced datasets could be further enhanced for more use cases beyond the requirement of the assignment itself, e.g. \n",
    "* Include TIMESTAMPS & DATEs in the local timezone as well as the timezone topic is traditionally fairly important to the operation of this business (since the provided TIMESTAMPs are all in UTC)\n",
    "* Enrich the dataset with more Dimensions, e.g. \"T-Dimensions\" (ISO week, Month, Quarter, Year, etc.), segmentation of the Venue & the Customers, etc.\n",
    "* Collect more business use cases and enrich the same dataset with more metrics, e.g. Delivery Time (time interval between Order Time Received & Time Delivered), Distance calculation (on top of the Straight Line method, there are also other mathematical ways to calculate the distances, e.g. [Euclidean distance](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)) --> this could be more fitted to new business use cases, for example improving delivery performance in new countries that has very different urban design\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the data still looks like more \"downstream\" in the picture. It may be an indicator of the team mentality (both data team and tech teams) - seeing data as a by-product of the applications/business or seeing data itself as a Product. If the awareness of seeing data as a Product is in place, the Primary Key of the events should be directly available in the data source instead of having to generate the surrogate key downstream."

    "Essentially, the nature of the Task 2 dataset is a Summary table containing pre-computed & pre-aggregated Metrics from both Sales (Purchases & Revenue) and Delivery Radius Events (Radius Reduction & Radius Modifications).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements to be involved \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The combined key of the Summary table\n",
    "In the summary table sum.purchases_delivery_radius_reduction, the columns being used as combine key are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `base_hour`\n",
    "* `delivery_area_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "These would be very vital when it comes to refreshing the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partitioning & Clustering\n",
    "Before actually implementing the dataset, there are MUST-HAVEs to be put in place for the sake of query performance & cost:\n",
    "* Partitioning (DATE/TIMESTAMP Partitioning in BigQuery, Micro-Partitions in Snowflake)\n",
    "* Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "These 2 elements are extremely important when it comes to high-volume & high-velocity data (e.g. tracking vents, or the `delivery_radius_log` in this assignment). Proper Partitioning would help the data warehouse skip irrelevant rows of records which leads to good performance, Clustering would help speed up identifying the relevant records to process. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors to consider\n",
    "There are a couple of factors that should be considered regarding deciding the Data Updating Strategy:\n",
    "* Freshness of the upstream data (i.e. `purchases` & `delivery_radius_log`) - and it is known to be near real-time\n",
    "* Business Requirement: Even if it is technically possible, it doesn't mean that it **has to** be delivered on near-realtime as well. At the end of the day, it depends on the business use-case.\n",
    "  * For example, if it is just used for daily reporting/dashboarding, then just a daily refresh would be enough;\n",
    "  * On the other hand, if someone from the business team is actively looking at those numbers literally a few times every hour AND makes decisions based on it, then **maybe** it makes sense to refresh on an hourly basis.\n",
    "    * This sort of business use case needs a more proper tech solution instead of depending on an analytical dataset, with the rationale of the resources required to maintain the SLA and the stability of the pipeline since high-velocity data pipelines tend to be more volatile than slower ones.\n",
    "* The Business Definitions of the metrics:\n",
    "  * The Sales related Metrics (Purchases & Revenue) are rather straightforward, as they often just anchor on the \"base TIMESTAMP\" (e.g. `time_received`) unless there is a special requirement from the business logic\n",
    "  * Yet, the trick lies with the event-based data interval calculation - namely Delivery Radius Reduction. It is tricky as the given definition of the Default Delivery Radius solely depends on the Delivery Radius sticking around for more than 24 hours.\n",
    "    * A better scenario would be whatever application or micro-service generating the change of Default Radius events available somewhere else (e.g. another Kafka topic) instead of populating everything in just 1 Kafka topic and ask the Data/BI team to do the transformation.\n",
    "      * The rationale behind is the principle of \"Shift Left\" - doing so at the beginning would just cost 1 Euro, doing so in the middle would cost 10 Euro, and doing it at the end could cost 100+ Euro.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposed Strategy\n",
    "Based on the factors mentioned above, here would be the spec of the Proposed update strategy:\n",
    "* Materialization: Incremental\n",
    "  * The TIMESTAMPs from the upstream tables (`purchases` & `delivery_radius_log`) would be required here to implement incremental filtering\n",
    "    * it is also equally important to plan for backfills in the future. Ideally speaking, there should be a condition statement (i.e. `IF`) to check if the current run is an Incremental one. If not, then the TIMESTAMP filter should be removed from the SQL statement to allow the data warehouse to process the whole table\n",
    "  * The combined key of `base_hour` + `delivery_area_id` in the Summary table would leverage to identify which exact record contains new Metrics from the run and hence should be updated as well\n",
    "* Interval: Hourly/Daily (depends on the business use case)\n",
    "  * It is mostly based on the required Dimension being on an hourly basis. Although it is technically possible to make it even more frequent, the cost of the additional volatility and potential confusion for the stakeholders (e.g. very low numbers of the latest record as the hour hasn't been completed yet)\n",
    "* Regular backfills & Re-clustering (e.g. every quarter/half-year, or even on an annual basis)\n",
    "  * While the Incremental load is good for performance & cost, if there are anomalies of the upstream events (e.g. the events arrive late but with a much older TIMESTAMP value), those records will never be covered by the incremental load\n",
    "  * While a table has records being inserted only for a certain period, the clustering would slowly be messy over time. It might be beneficial to have it re-clustered once a while \n",

    "***Notes***\n",
    "* It is not recommended that the pattern of truncating the table first due to resilience consideration.\n",
    "  * Depending on which data warehouse is being used (e.g. Snowflake), there is a chance truncating operations would cause problems. Since truncating and inserting are different queries, if there is a service disruption and somehow makes one of the queries fail, it would result in duplication or unexpected missing records (there is also a risk of having the whole table empty if human error is in the mix)\n",
    "* Last but not least, the use of Incremental Load is a 2-edged sword. It brings the benefit of performance & cost, while it also introduces extra complexity. It is vital to ensure the foundation & tech debt are in a good state to implement this.\n"

    "As a starter, there are 2 very critical fields/columns missing from the `delivery_radius_log`:\n",
    "1. A Primary Key (e.g. `event_id`)\n",
    "    * A Surrogate Key can still be derived by using both of `delivery_area_id` & `event_started_timestamp`. It is okay in most cases, **but** in certain corner cases (e.g. duplicated events from the upstream application/micro-service, Kafka events replay), even the Surrogate Key would be duplicated.\n",
    "3. TIMESTAMPs indicating when is the event being ingested into the data warehouse (e.g. `created_at`, `updated_at`, or `ingested_at`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine if these 2 columns exist in `delivery_radius_log`, the schema would look like this:\n",
    "* `event_id`\n",
    "* `delivery_area_id`\n",
    "* `delivery_radius_meters`\n",
    "* `event_started_timestamp`\n",
    "* `ingested_at`\n",
    "\n",
    "then, it would be possible to leverage the strength of the data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery) to do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT * EXCEPT (_row_number)\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "        , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY event_id ORDER BY ingested_at DESC) AS _row_number\n",
    "    FROM delivery_radius_log\n",
    ")\n",
    "WHERE _row_number = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is in place, the data pipeline would still be fairly resilient even if there are duplications from the streaming events (e.g. replaying in Kafka)."
